Every month I have the fabulous task of compiling a best dressed list. I attend some fabulous events, sort through hundreds of photos from the past month to find the best of the best. I do a roundup of events that played host to some of the most sartorially savvy, polished, eclectic, and stylish of dressers. 

March, the month of Colombo Fashion Week, saw some serious Sri Lankan style both on and off the ramp. It also saw the celebration of two of Colombo’s finest restaurants - the Ministry of Crab and Nihonbashi on Asia's top 50 among others. All out glamour seemed to be on trend for March and the people on my list impressed with their style, their poise, their ability to pull a unique look together and were the most soigne of the soigne for the month. These style mavens know how to turn heads. There was no shortage of fashion hits from this most fashionable month and I look forward to seeing how our city’s sartorially savvy bring more stylish looks in April.
