The countrywide fuel distribution will be restored within today, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody said. Speaking to Daily Mirror, Minister said the CPC workers have abandoned their strike following a written assurance given by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, and will engage in their regular duties today. However, when contacted CPC Trade unions’ collective Media Spokesman Bandula Saman Kumara said at least three days will be needed to restore total distribution. “There was already a shortage in fuel after the New Year season. With the trade union action it increased. We believe at least three more days will be needed to settle the situation,” he said. Mr. Kumara also said that per day ordinary demand is Diesel 4,500 – 5,000 metric tons, Petrol 2,500- 3,000 metric tons, Kerosene 200 metric tons. - See more at: http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Fuel-distribution-to-return-to-normalcy-today-Minister-127742.html
