The reforms, along with promises for big infrastructure spending, were a key driver of a global equity rally since the tycoon\u2019s November election win.\nThe news was met with relief by Wall Street, with the Nasdaq leading a surge in all three main indexes and hitting a new record high. The dollar, which has struggled in recent weeks against the safe-haven yen, also broke out of its malaise, buying 109.34 yen from 109.31 yen in New York and well up from 108.80 yen in Asia Thursday.\nAdding to the dollar bounce were comments from a top Federal Reserve official saying he expected the central bank to hike interest rates three times this year.\nTokyo\u2019s Nikkei closed up one percent as exporters were boosted by the weaker yen and comments from Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda that he would maintain a loose monetary policy, despite an improvement in the economy.\nSydney put on 0.6 percent, Seoul jumped 0.7 percent and Taipei 0.9 percent. There were also strong gains in Singapore and Manila. Jakarta was higher after US Vice President Mike Pence announced US$10 billion in US-Indonesian deals.\nShanghai was flat, with investors fretting over news that Trump had ordered a probe into US steel imports, which raised anew the threat of a trade war between the US and China.\nBut Hong Kong suffered a sell-off in the final hour to end 0.1 percent lower.\u00a0\nOn forex markets the euro suffered a brief dive against the dollar after a gunman who the Islamic State group said was one of their followers opened fire in the middle of Paris, killing\u00a0\none policeman.\nThe currency later recovered and was flat against the dollar in early Asian trade.\n\u201cIt looks like the Trump administration wants to reignite the market\u2019s expectations for policies,\u201d Hideyuki Ishiguro, a senior strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo, told Bloomberg News.\n\u201cKuroda\u2019s comments didn\u2019t diverge from his past stance, but since the yen had strengthened a fair amount it became a trigger for some profit-taking.\u201d\nAttention now turns to this weekend\u2019s first-round presidential vote in France, with a four-way split leaving analysts unable to work out which two candidates are likely to win through a second phase.\nWhile there are fears the far-right Marine Le Pen will qualify, observers believe the moderate Emmanuel Macron will beat her in next month\u2019s run-off.\nHowever, there is unease that a win for Le Pen could lead to France\u2019s exit from the European Union and possible collapse of the bloc.\nIn early European trade Paris fell 0.3 percent in the first reaction to the shooting, while Frankfurt was flat but London added 0.2 percent.\n-AFP\n\u00a0\n\n", "business"], ["\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAmid the dearth of foreign investments to Sri Lanka, SK Group, a Fortune 500 company and South Korea\u2019s 3rd largest diversified conglomerate yesterday announced that it will be making a US$30-40 million equity investment in local car manufacturing and assembly pioneer Micro Holdings (Pvt) Ltd.\n\u201cIt is an honour to partner with Micro. We are hoping to help Micro expand its production facilities, its industry related clusters and new projects Micro is investing in,\u201d SK Group Senior Vice President C.H.

But of course they know our company well. After the due diligence they will do the investment,\u201d he said.\nMicro has an office in South Korea, and assembles South Korean cars in Sri Lanka, which has exposed Micro to South Korean firms. SK Group is the world\u2019s second largest electric vehicle battery manufacturer, and Dr. Perera said that the technology would be put to use in the company\u2019s latest offering, an electric vehicle, the prototype of which was unveiled this January.\n\u201cThe future is electric cars,\u201d he said.\nLee said that electric cars assembled by Micro would be exported globally, while Dr. Perera said that initial plans are to export electric vehicles to the South Asian region.\nHe said that while Micro\u2019s US$ 13.5 million production plant, which produces around 50 vehicles daily would get some of SK Group\u2019s investment, Micro\u2019s future expansions will receive significant financing from SK as well.\n\u201cEspecially our construction sector. SK is a hospitality management company and we are a construction company and we could own hotels,\u201d he said.\nDr. Perera said that the investment signifies a victory for Sri Lanka by showing the world that leading companies in the world are interested in Sri Lanka\u2019s industrial sector.\nHe said that SK Group is also interested in taking Micro public, which the company had been mulling during the past 3 years.\n\u201cOur plans for an initial public offering are still on. There\u2019s no date yet. But SK is public and they\u2019re also interested in us going public,\u201d Dr. Perera added.\nMicro also has plans to expand further with high tech public transportation in\u00a0\nSri Lanka.

There are still some areas on which (EU) Members of Parliament have already signalled their concern,\u201d EU Delegation to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires Paul Godfrey told\u00a0\nMirror Business.\nAlthough GSP Plus was a hot topic in the past, it has been nudged away from public debate due to government policy blunders in foreign investments, urban planning and trade relations. The EU Delegation this week tweeted a reminder that the application process was ending\u00a0\nnext month. Godfrey urged Sri Lankan politicians not to become complacent in their efforts at the eleventh hour in hopes that no EU MP would object to Sri Lanka\u2019s application. \u201cSri Lanka and the Government of Sri Lanka should not be complacent that it (an objection) would not happen. They must convey that they are serious about their commitment to implement the necessary changes,\u201d\u00a0\nhe said.\nGodfrey said that although there are various concerns among the EU\u2019s 670 MPs, there is a general consensus that Sri Lanka must address issues related to shortcomings in the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, and children\u2019s rights, to gain a better standing in the EU parliament.\nThe EU, which absorbs nearly a third of Sri Lanka\u2019s exports, rescinded the GSP Plus facility from Sri Lanka in 2010 due to 15 violations notched under these\u00a0\nthree categories.\nEU MPs in the EU Parliament Trade Commission this month sent a not-so-friendly letter to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe reminding Sri Lanka of its commitments in these three areas, as well as that of equal rights to people of different sexual orientations as conditions to enjoying GSP Plus.\nGodfrey said Sri Lanka must show commitment by replacing the Prevention of Terrorism Act with global standard Counter Terrorism legislation, amending the Code of Criminal Procedure to allow suspects the right to a lawyer and bring in legislation to oppose\u00a0\nchild marriages.\nThe government last month published two pieces of proposed amendments and new legislation to allow suspects the right to a lawyer, and to set up a Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Rights Council, although no amendments or new legislation have yet been published for the Prevention of Terrorism Act, or the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, which allows for minors to be married off.\nAttempts to amend the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act and to provide equal rights to people of different sexual orientations have drawn heavy resistance from some quarters of the public.\nGodfrey said the EU has observed new legislation related to regaining GSP Plus being formulated, but noted it will reserve its comments until the end of the legislation adjustment period.\n\u201cWe, like everyone else, would like to see the final details of the adjustments, because the movement of one or two words could change the implementation. None of these are new commitments, because Sri Lanka signed these conventions in the past,\u201d he said.\nForeign Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva told Mirror Business that the government is hopeful of Sri Lanka regaining GSP Plus.\n\u201cAll issues are being addressed at the highest levels,\u201d he said, declining to comment any further.\nSri Lanka lost its status as a GSP Plus beneficiary in 2010 following the culmination of a 30-year civil war, when international forces collaborated to bring cases of human rights violations against the country for alleged crimes committed during the last stages of the war.\nThousands lost employment, specially in the apparel sector, due to the loss of the preferential trade facility.\nFollowing the election of the current government, which hoped to forge alliances with the West, Sri Lanka reapplied for GSP Plus last July.\nThe European Commission recommended to the EU Parliament to award Sri Lanka GSP Plus this January, based on promises of reforms made by Sri Lanka.\nFinance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said Sri Lanka could gain an annual tariff windfall of around US$ 1.9 billion if it regained GSP Plus.\nSri Lanka can enjoy GSP Plus until 3 years after it is consistently classified as an upper middle income country by the World Bank.\u00a0\nAlthough Sri Lanka may become an upper middle income country within the next one or two years based on its current growth path, Godfrey in the past had said that Sri Lanka may enjoy GSP Plus till 2023.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n", "politics"], ["\n\u00a0\nFinance Minister Ravi Karunanayake made surprise visits to several supermarkets in Colombo on April 9 to ascertain whether the standard commodity prices are maintained in the market.

The total investment for the project is estimated at over US $ 100 million.\u00a0\nAdding a total of 784 rooms, the project will encompass three Hilton Hotels & Resort properties and also witness the debut of the award-winning \u2018DoubleTree\u2019 by Hilton.\nThe properties unveiled would be Hilton Kandy Resort (150 rooms), Hilton Yala Resort & Spa (42 rooms), Hilton Kosgoda Resort (200 rooms), DoubleTree by Hilton Nuwara Eliya (96 rooms), DoubleTree by Hilton Negombo (96 rooms) and DoubleTree by Hilton Colombo International Airport (200 rooms).\nOf the lot, three of the properties are scheduled to open between 2020 and 2021.Addressing a ceremonial signing event in Colombo yesterday, Hilton Vice President Operations Southeast Asia and India William Costley stressed the locations were picked to ensure the properties are strategically located in the heart of tourist attractions, allowing leisure travellers to reap the full benefits of the \u201cburgeoning\u201d growth in the island nation\u2019s tourism. \u00a0Commenting on the partnership, Costley said Hilton is confident in working with a partner of experience and standing such as Melwa Hotels & Resorts to advance its footprint within Sri Lanka. Hilton currently manages The Hilton Colombo and Hilton Residencies, commonly known as JAIC Hilton.\u00a0\nAcknowledging the brand is keen on partaking in Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism boom, Costley said, \u201cThe international arrivals are charting an impressive growth trajectory and the government launching a series of initiatives, such as road network expansion, to grow the sector, will certainly positively impact the six proposed hotels.\u201d\nOpining that tourism in Sri Lanka is still in its infancy, Costley said, Hilton has further plans in taking up more properties in the country as it is an \u201cimportant market\u201d.\nHilton has over 300 properties in the pipeline to open in the Asia Pacific alone in the next three to five years.\n\u00a0\n\n", "business"], ["\n\u00a0\nThe Cargills group this week commissioned the country\u2019s largest multi-product dairy manufacturing plant in Banduragoda, Gampaha, as a part of its Rs.3 billion dairy expansion project which began two years ago.\u00a0\nThe production facility was ceremonially opened by President Maithripala Sirisena on Monday and over 300 dairy farmers and their families representing a farmer base of over 15, 000 attended the event.\nCargills (Ceylon) PLC Deputy Chairman Ranjit Page noted that with a vision to be the most trusted Sri Lankan dairy brand, Cargills efforts are focused on being among the largest contributors to the national dairy industry.\u00a0\n\u201cWith the opening of this plant, Cargills salutes the efforts of Sri Lanka\u2019s small holder dairy farmers and in turn makes the commitment to help our country achieve self-sufficiency in meeting the nutritional requirements of all Sri Lankans,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\u201cThe development of the dairy industry has the amazing potential to impact regional livelihoods, enhance the nutritional intake of our children while also saving valuable foreign exchange for Sri Lanka.\u00a0\nSri Lanka continues to depend on imported milk powder to meet the dairy nutritional needs of our children. Steps taken by the government to encourage dairy farming must be complemented with processing and sourcing capacities and it is our role as the private sector to invest towards long-term growth,\u201d Page added.\u00a0\nOver the last 12 months, Cargills has collected 42 million litres of fresh milk from small farmers, generating a direct income of Rs. 2.8 billion for rural Sri Lanka and saving US $ 20 million in foreign exchange to the country in the last financial year.\u00a0\nCargills entered the dairy industry in 2002 through the acquisition of an ice cream facility owned by a multi-national company.\u00a0\nThis plant that was shutdown at the time of acquisition was transformed to utilize fresh milk; a move that was in tandem with Cargills\u2019 philosophy to create value for rural Sri Lanka through business.\u00a0\nThis facilitated the empowerment of thousands of dairy farmers through commercial scale farming.\n\u00a0\u201cOver the years, Cargills has invested over Rs. 5 billion in developing a range of dairy production lines while enhancing infrastructure and logistics support to increase the sourcing of fresh milk from small dairy farmers,\u201d Cargills (Ceylon) PLC Managing Director Imtiaz Wahid said.\n\u201cA Rs. 3 billion dairy expansion project rolled out by us during the last two years has resulted in the development of a full range of dairy products, including UHT milk, yoghurts, drinking and stirred yoghurt, curd, cheese and a substantial increase in ice cream production facilities with the latest technology.\u00a0\nThe investment also led to the establishment of unique processing and storage capabilities that would allow Cargills to overcome the seasonal fluctuations of milk production, and thereby source the full supply of milk from farmers during gluts and maintain prices during scarcity,\u201d he added.\u00a0\nCargills currently collects 125, 000 litres of fresh milk from over 15, 000 dairy farmers daily and has launched a number of initiatives to engage with farmers, going beyond its role as a buyer of local dairy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n", "business"], ["\n\u00a0\nBy Shabiya Ali Ahlam\nSri Lanka\u2019s tea industry has hit another stumbling block with the much-awaited global promotional campaign being put off for another few more months due to the shortcomings in the tender procedures and questionable capabilities of some of the selected service providers, Mirror Business learns. \u00a0\nThe Plantation Industries Ministry expressed confidence this January in kicking off the campaign in April, after an almost four-year long wait. The ministry said the promotional campaign was split into three segments\u2014creative, media buying and public relations (PR). However, now the ministry and Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB) have decided to have a relook at the tenders carried out for selecting suitable parties for media buying and PR, while the creative part will go ahead as planned with the selected partner, Phoenix Ogilvy.\nThe decision to look for new partners was taken two weeks ago jointly by the ministry and SLTB\u00a0\nFresh tenders in this regard are expected to be called in the coming weeks.\nAccording to the SLTB, the tenders received for media buying were defective and were rejected by the cabinet-appointed tender board. With only two proposals being received, one was quoted in foreign currency\u2014not acceptable according to the tender regulations\u2014whereas the other quoted an \u201cextraordinarily\u201d high fee.\nMeanwhile, the SLTB has decided to do the PR part of the campaign on its own as the partner that initially won the bid is said to have lacked the required capacity.\n\u201cThis (tender recalling process) will delay the campaign by at least three to four months. But the thing is there is also a need for transparency. The tender boards now are highly cautious of doing anything suspicious and they want to be absolutely straightforward,\u201d said SLTB Chairman Rohan Pethiyagoda, providing clarity over the unexpected turn of events.\nHe added that with transparency being a key requirement, the process will \u201ctake some time\u201d.\nWhen questioned on the implications of the prolonged delay of the campaign on the industry, Pethiyagoda pointed out that the promotion primarily aims at increasing the value and awareness of the Ceylon Tea brand and not to increase the volumes exported or fetch higher prices.\n\u201cWhat the global campaign intends to do is to reinforce in the minds of consumers that Ceylon Tea is of high value, which is to stress it is a premium. But that is not to say that every consumer will buy it. It is about creating a reputation in the consumer market, which may not translate into greater volume of tea being sold or fetching higher prices,\u201d explained the STLB chief.\nWith the expected outcome of the campaign being intangible, he stressed the relevant authorities are cautious on spending, thus the whole exercise is undergoing a number of \u201cbureaucratic steps\u201d that are necessary. \u00a0\nThe SLTB originally aimed to kick off the global campaign in mid-2012 but the mega task was put off to October 2013 and then towards end-January 2014, due to not having a suitable promotional partner.\nThe exercise will be carried out through the money collected from the tea cess, which is estimated to be around Rs.6.75 billion. The cess fund was created in 2010, where a Tea Promotion and Marketing Levy of Rs.3.50 for every kilo of tea exported was introduced.\n\u00a0\n\n", "politics"], ["\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAn economist has criticized the government\u2019s tax policy on vehicle imports and the recent credit restrictions imposed on vehicle financing, calling them detrimental towards inclusive growth as such policies deprive access to a three-wheeler or a mini-truck by the butchers, bakers, plumbers and the like, who create economic wealth. \u00a0\nHence, according to Murtaza Jafferjee, the Managing Director of JB Securities, a Colombo-based equity brokerage and a research house, such restraining policies on vehicle imports will drive the underprivileged segments into poverty and will also create social pressures because one who bought a mini-truck before the budget (2017) is significantly better-off than a person who could not purchase a truck.\nThe budget 2017 imposed a minimum excise duty of Rs.1.0 million for mini-trucks, which is a three-fold increase. On top of that, the Monetary Board imposed a 25 percent loan-to-value ratio on three-wheeler financing, jacking up the average initial down payment on three-wheelers from Rs.200, 000 to Rs.485, 000.\u00a0\nAs a result, only 903 three-wheeler registrations were recorded in February, still high but significantly down from 3,327 units in January. The mini-truck registrations fell to 298 units from 559 units.\u00a0\nAs per the data compiled by JB Securities, monthly three-wheeler registrations averaged at 6,000 units a month while mini-trucks averaged at 1,400 a month in 2016. According to \u00a0Jafferjee, both types are used mostly by micro-enterprise owners operating with less than 5 people in creating higher economic growth.\n\u201cAn integral capital input for a micro enterprise is a basic utilitarian vehicle such as a three-wheeler and/or a mini lorry\u2014(where) the marginal return to capital is very high.\u00a0\nA baker who has access to a mobile retailing unit through a modified three-wheeler or mini truck enjoys much greater sales \u2013 carrying and displaying capacity is greater, radius of travel is 10 times more, alternator can charge the battery that can power a fan or food warmer, etc.\u00a0\nThe bottom line (is) the current vehicle taxation policy is detrimental towards greater inclusive development and impedes higher economic efficiency by distorting the market for vehicles. Continuing with such a policy will have electoral repercussions,\u201d Jafferjee said in his monthly analysis on vehicle registrations. \u00a0\nTo prove his point, he compared the taxes paid in Sri Lanka and the Philippines\u2014a similar lower middle income country with high population density and theatrical politics\u2014 on popular Toyota hybrid vehicles.\nIn the comparison he showed, Sri Lankan car buyers are paying between 26 -175 percent more taxes for a car. He also said per capita GDP in Philippines is US $ 3,000 whereas in Sri Lanka it is US $ 4,000.\u00a0\nThe per capita GDP comparison however suggests Lankans could afford to pay a higher excise duty when importing a car than Filipinos. \u00a0\nIn this context, Jafferjee calls for the imposition of early sunset clauses on tax holiday periods enjoyed by firms earning super profits rather than imposing a higher burden on the economically underprivileged through indirect taxes, if the government wants to increase its revenues.\u00a0\nAlternatively he also proposed to increase the fuel prices to reduce the demand and/or the re-imposition of the fuel price surcharge above the life line rate on electricity due to the drought.\u00a0\nThrough these proposals, Jafferjee appears to be fine with the entire population being slapped with additional fuel or electricity to compensate government inefficiencies, to provide an easy passage for a few to buy three-wheelers and mini-trucks under the guise of micro-enterprises who create mayhem when using the roads, risking the lives of others and their own. \u00a0Jafferjee also proposed to resume priority lanes for buses and also to impose congestion fee to control the massive influx of vehicles daily into the Colombo city. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u201cIn conclusion, inability to widen the tax net is not a reason to create a highly distortionary vehicle taxation system. It deprives choice, distorts the playing field and is unfair for those who pay their fair share of taxes \u2013 the highest marginal tax rate on PAYE has been increased from 16 percent to 24 percent from April 1. If people pay their taxes, it\u2019s only fair that they can buy a vehicle of their choice at a reasonable price\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\n\n", "business"], ["\n\u00a0\nAn Indian woman reads a notice board as she stands in a queue outside the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to exchange old 500 and 1000 currency notes in Mumbai on yesterday.

With the launch of digital bank branch solution, we are taking our association to the next level of digital offerings to our valued customers in Sri Lanka\u201d.\nThe recent trends show that consumers of financial services are turning to computers, smartphones, and tablets more for their business interactions with banks.\u00a0\nWith wider availability of high-speed telecom networks across large geographies, the technology adoption is much faster across various customer segments.

Emirates has been talking to us. AirAsia has spoken to us. Last week they were to come to see me. They asked for an appointment but they have changed the time. IndiGo is also interested,\u201d Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim said.\nHe was speaking yesterday at a breakfast meeting on public-private partnerships (PPPs) organised by the Sri Lanka-Malaysia Business Council of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.\nThe government, in the latter part of last year, called for expressions of interest (EoIs) from international parties for a PPP with the debt-ridden SriLankan in a bid to cut down the burden created by the airline to the country\u2019s finances.\u00a0\nBut it appears that the parties who showed interest were not to the liking of the government. \u00a0Hashim\u2019s co-pilot, Public Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne, last month told Mirror Business that the government had decided not to go for a second round of EoIs but instead would be directly marketing SriLankan to global airlines and that discussions were at initial stages with some players.\nHashim yesterday said that the government has given the four new airlines until May to express their level of interest. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe earlier had said that SriLankan would have a partner by April.\n\u201cBut even when they show interest, it doesn\u2019t mean much, because when they come and look at our books and think this is a no-go, they will go off. So, we are not thinking they\u2019re going to take it, but it at least shows that they are interested in us, that there are players in the market thinking that SriLankan has potential,\u201d he said.\nThe government is looking to sell 49 percent of SriLankan shares to a partner, who would have completed management control of the airline with one or two board seats to be held by the government, Hashim said.\nUS-based global investment giant Texas Pacific Group (TPG), which has investments in Sri Lankan listed entities, became the final candidate that qualified through the first EoI selection process set by the government. However, the government doesn\u2019t appear confident in the final selection.\n\u201cTPG is not an airline company. So, maybe we might lose the identity of the airline. So, we will take the best option for the country,\u201d Hashim said.\nHe added that TPG may not present the government with a favourable offer as well.\n\u201cWe have given them (TPG) the option to do due diligence and give their offer. We may not be happy with that offer, so we are not compelled to take their offer,\u201d he said.\nWickramaratne had said that even if TPG provides a favourable financing offer, the government may have to find a third party to manage the airline, given TPG\u2019s lack of airline management experience.\nSriLankan has been running at a loss since former President Mahinda Rajapaksa kicked Emirates out of a similar partnership arrangement to the one sought now in 2009 over personal reasons and appointed his brother-in-law as the head, during whose tenure, the airline was scandal-ridden and grossly mismanaged.\nEven with the change of government and low oil prices, the new top management, appointed by the prime minister, only managed to cut down net losses to Rs.12.08 billion in 2016, down from Rs.16.33 billion year-on-year.\nThe accumulated losses were Rs.135.59 billion and the liabilities were Rs.95.07 billion, of which Rs.67.60 billion bore interest. Mihin Air, which was merged with SriLankan last year, has incurred losses exceeding Rs.15 billion.\n\u00a0\n\n", "business"], ["\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBy Chandeepa Wettasinghe\nThe world\u2019s largest multilateral lender, the European Investment Bank (EIB), will be ramping up its funding to Sri Lanka due to the efforts made by the government, the head of the bank\u2019s delegation currently in town said yesterday during a media briefing held at the Finance Ministry.\n\u201cGiven the vision shown by all those I have met here today, the detailed preparations made for this visit and the enlightened discussions we\u2019ve had here in Colombo, I would expect new projects to be identified and confirmed later this year,\u201d EIB Vice President South Asia Andrew McDowell said.\nHe noted that in addition to the continued expansion of financing in areas EIB has in the past funded Sri Lanka due to the satisfactory implementation by agencies here, new areas of investment have also been identified, which would require further studies by EIB.\n\u201cWe will examine these new areas and we plan to see how Sri Lanka will benefit from them,\u201d he said.\nEIB has to date financed water and wastewater management projects, public transportation, tsunami recovery assistance and small and medium enterprise (SME) credit lines worth 300 million Euros since it entered the country in 2002.\nFinance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said renewable energy would be one of the new focus areas of EIB funding.\nMcDowell said EIB funds sustainable development projects based on demand, instead of allocating funding annually per country, and that it will evaluate and approve funding for the projects the Sri Lankan government presents that fall within EIB\u2019s lending criteria.\nKarunanayake however said it is too early for Sri Lanka to decide on the size and scope of projects it would forward to EIB to seek funding.\n\u201cWe would like them to come here and see us, and be confident in us. It\u2019s too premature to talk about the amounts,\u201d he said.\nEuropean Union Ambassador in Sri Lanka Tung-Lai Margue said that discussions are underway to change the way the EU and EIB implemented projects in Sri Lanka.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying more and more to use a blending approach\u2014to make sure projects are combining grants and loans. The EU can provide grants, and the EIB can provide loans at interesting interest rates with its shrewd expertise,\u201d he said.\nAccording to McDowell, EIB has its own interest rates, which are the lowest in the world compared to other similar institutions, and the interest rates change based on the projects.\n\u201cWhen it comes to the investment grade of a country, it\u2019s not so clear,\u201d he said, adding that interest rates may or may not change based on ratings or income level of a country, but that rates may change depending on instructions and budgetary allocations given to it by the EU.\nHe noted that EIB is independent from the EU, but that the EU decides the funding limits for each geographical region.\nMargue however noted that the largest amount of funding for projects initiated with EIB comes from third parties.\n\u201cThrough its (EIB\u2019s) label, other private investors will also come in,\u201d he said, explaining the increase in profile Sri Lanka will enjoy with further stamps of approval from EIB.\nMcDowell noted that with every project, EIB financed just one third of the investment, with the rest coming from private investors.\nMcDowell\u2019s visit is the first high level visit by an EIB official since the institution entered Sri Lanka 15 years ago, and he noted that with the EIB South Asia branch, which was set up in New Delhi recently, Sri Lanka will see a larger presence of EIB on the ground in the future.\n\u201cThis is the first country I\u2019m visiting outside of Europe as the newly appointed Vice President of the bank, and that certainly reflects the bank\u2019s great interest and prioritizing attached to the development of this country when it comes to our Asian operations,\u201d he said.\nHe said that the visit was made possible by the invitation Karunanayake extended in Brussels when a 50 million Euro programme was signed for a wastewater management project in Colombo earlier this year. Margue called the visit a great improvement of Sri Lanka-EU relations ahead of the announcement of the results of Sri Lanka\u2019s GSP Plus application. EIB, owned by the 28 EU nations, extended 80 billion Euros of funding in 2016, and has committed itself to over 570 billion Euros in funding across 160 countries.\nThe current Sri Lankan government had turned to the western world for funding and support when it first came to power, but has now turned to the previous government\u2019s ally China due to the lack of an early response from the West.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n", "business"], ["\n\u00a0\nTourists watch a Sri Lankan elephant walk through a field in the Minneriya National Park.

Sri Lanka\u2019s countrywide consumer prices rose 8.2 percent in February with food prices rising 0.31 percent, the data released by the Census and Statistics Department showed. With the festive season arriving, the prices are set to increase further due to the demand-side pressures (Reuters)\n\n", "sports"], ["\n\u00a0\nThe food and non-food prices measured by the national consumer price index surged 8.2 percent during the 12 months to February 2017, jumping from 6.5 percent from a year ago, the data released by the statistics office showed.\u00a0\nAccording to analysts, this should prompt the country\u2019s monetary authority to act fast to avert a possible overheating of the economy. National consumer price index measures the countrywide inflation, a broader reflection of price movements than the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI).\u00a0\nThe main culprit for the steeper increase in consumer prices was the food prices, which rose by 0.31 percent between January and February.\u00a0\nThe increase in coconut prices was the sharpest during February as the price of a nut shot up to Rs.75 to Rs.80 during this period from around Rs.40 to Rs.50 a couple of months ago.\u00a0\nVegetables recorded the next highest increase in prices while the coconut oil prices also rose.\u00a0\nThe prices of rice came down as a result of imports by the government and selling them at controlled prices.\u00a0\nHowever, on a Year-on-Year basis food prices rose by 0.7 percent in February, down from 1.8 percent increase in January 2017 due to base effects.\u00a0\nThe prolonged drought, the worst in four decades, has had severe impact on the country\u2019s food prices as the cultivation has become difficult during this period.\nThe indications are such that the situation could get much worse during the coming months as only 35 percent of cultivable rice paddy land had been farmed by the end of November 2016\u2014the lowest level in 30 years, Ministry of Disaster Management and World Food Programme said recently.\u00a0\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) last week asked the Central Bank to stand ready to tighten the monetary policy further unless inflation and credit conditions showed some abatement.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, the non-food prices also rose albeit at a lesser pace driven by the increase in tuition fees, cost of servicing vehicles and house maintenance cost.\nThe higher value added tax appears to have pushed up the prices of these categories.\u00a0\nThe moving average inflation for February 2017 also picked up to 5.1 percent from 4.6 percent in January 2017. \u00a0Earlier, the Census and Statistics Department released data showed the headline inflation measured by the Colombo Consumer Price Index for February 2017 rising to 6.8 percent Year-on-Year accelerating from 5.5 percent in January 2017.\u00a0\nThe core inflation rose by 7.1percent Year-on-Year in February from 7.0 percent in January 2017.\u00a0\nSri Lanka is getting ready for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year in April, which is the largest festival celebrated by the majority Sinhalese and the Tamil community. The prices naturally tend to increase during this season due to demand factors.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n", "business"]]';
